# Project_Airbnb
In this project, my main goal was to develop a predictive model to estimate Airbnb listing prices in the city of Lyon by analyzing how prices are influenced by different variables, and to provide personalized recommendations to users.

Steps followed: 
- Data Preprocessing and EDA
Certain variables were imputed with a KNN Regressor.

- Predictive Model Development
Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to build the model.

- Interactive Dashboard Design
Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize the insights.

- Result Presentation Application
Developed a Streamlit app to showcase the findings.
