# Project_Airbnb
In this project, my main goal was to develop a predictive model to estimate Airbnb listing prices in the city of Lyon by analyzing how prices are influenced by different variables, and to provide personalized recommendations to users.

Steps followed: 

1. Data Preprocessing and EDA <br/>
Certain variables were imputed with a KNN Regressor.

2. Predictive Model Development <br/>
Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to build the model.

3. Interactive Dashboard Design <br/>
Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize the insights.

4. Result Presentation Application <br/>
Developed a Streamlit app to showcase the findings.
