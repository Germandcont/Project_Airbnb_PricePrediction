# Project_Airbnb
In this project, my main goal was to develop a predictive model to estimate Airbnb listing prices in the city of Lyon by analyzing how prices are influenced by different variables, and to provide personalized recommendations to users.

Steps followed: 
- 1 Data preprocesing and EDA
   - Some variables were imputed using a KNN Regressor.
  
- 2 Predictive Model development (Using Random Forest Regressor)

- 3 Designed and built an interactive Power BI dashboard.

- 4 Built a Streamlit application to showcase the results.
